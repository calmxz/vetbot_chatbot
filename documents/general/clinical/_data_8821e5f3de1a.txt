An animal’s behavior is the product of its genetic composition, the environment in which the animal functions, and the animal’s experience (particularly in the pre- and postnatal environment through the primary socialization period).
The term "ethology" refers to the scientific field of study concerned with the behavior of animals in nature. From a veterinary medical perspective, behavioral medicine incorporates ethology to help understand species-specific behavior and welfare needs of both domesticated and captive wild animals in diagnosing and treating behavior problems in human-made environments.
The Five Freedoms
The Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare, developed by Britain's Farm Animal Welfare Council in 1965, is a globally recognized standard for conceptualizing the minimum welfare requirements for housing and enrichment of all animals, including farm, zoo, and laboratory animals, as well as family pets. The Five Freedoms are as follows:
freedom from hunger and thirst
freedom from discomfort
freedom from pain, injury, or disease
freedom from fear and distress
freedom to express normal species behaviors
When these needs are not fully addressed, welfare is compromised, and problems with both physical health and behavior arise.
With companion animals, behavior problems may weaken the pet–owner bond and decrease an owner's commitment to pet care. Behavior problems are a primary reason for pet relinquishment and euthanasia. Yet many owners do not report behavior changes to their veterinarian, and most veterinarians neglect to inquire about them. Thus, veterinarians should screen for behavior changes or emerging behavior problems at each veterinary visit to ensure that the pet's behavioral and physical health, as well as its welfare, are being effectively and humanely managed.
