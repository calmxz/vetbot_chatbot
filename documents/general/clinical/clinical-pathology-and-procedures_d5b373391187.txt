PROFESSIONAL VERSION
Diagnostic imaging is one of the most frequently used categories of diagnostic testing in both small and large animal hospitals throughout the world. Imaging provides a large amount of information through noninvasive means and does not alter disease processes or cause unacceptable discomfort to patients.
Radiography is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in veterinary practice, but other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear imaging are also very important and are commonly available in specialty practices and academic centers.
