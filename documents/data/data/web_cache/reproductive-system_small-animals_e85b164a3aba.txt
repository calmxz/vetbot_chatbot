Phimosis is an abnormally small preputial orifice, resulting in the inability to extrude the penis. The condition can be congenital, or it can be acquired as a result of neoplasia, edema, or fibrosis after trauma, inflammation, or infection.

Clinical signs of phimosis vary. Usually, the problem goes unnoticed until the dog or cat attempts to breed and is unable to copulate. Urine can pool in the prepuce and cause posthitis.

Diagnosis of phimosis is by physical examination of the prepuce and penis.
Treatment of phimosis depends on severity of the stenosis and lack of response to topical therapy.
Surgical enlargement of the preputial orifice (see preoperative and postoperative images) is indicated if the animal is to be used for breeding, if phimosis contributes to balanoposthitis, or in the unlikely event that phimosis interferes with normal micturition.
