Clinical features of hepatobiliary disease vary depending on type, mechanism, severity, zonal distribution and extent of involved parenchyma, and chronicity.
Important Features of Acquired and Congenital Hepatobiliary Disorders
General features include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever.
With severe, diffuse injury or cholestatic disorders (disorders causing bile flow stasis), animals may develop jaundice (yellow discoloration of nonpigmented tissues due to accumulation of bilirubin), polyuria (dilute urine production) and polydipsia (excessive water consumption), coagulation abnormalities (bleeding tendencies), or abdominal distention due to ascites (accumulation of abdominal effusion secondary to intrahepatic sinusoidal hypertension or prehepatic portal hypertension).
