The primary function of the reproductive system is to perpetuate the species. This system also provides the mechanism for the recombination of genetic material that allows for evolutionary change and adaptation. Manipulation of the reproductive system in breeding management programs facilitates rapid and dramatic changes in the conformation and productivity of domestic animals. Theriogenology is the veterinary specialty that deals with reproduction. (Also see chapters on the management of reproduction in cattle, goats, horses, pigs, sheep, and dogs and cats.)

Features of the Reproductive Cycle
The reproductive system is incredibly complex in both its anatomy and physiology, and all aspects must be considered when resolving reproductive problems. The differences in the reproductive system between the sexes and among species are extensive. Both sexes have primary sex organs and primary regulatory centers. Gonads and function-adapted, tubular genital organs constitute primary sex organs in both sexes. The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are the primary regulatory centers; thus, the regulatory function is, in part, neuroendocrine. In pregnant females, the fetoplacental unit plays a substantial role in maintaining and terminating pregnancy.
