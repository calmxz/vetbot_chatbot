Reproductive system diseases occur in both sexually intact (unneutered) and neutered male dogs and cats. Affected organs can include the urethra, testes (whether normally descended into the scrotum or undescended [cryptorchidism]), penis, and prepuce; disease can also extend to other parts of the genitourinary system, such as the prostate gland, urethra, and urinary bladder.
Dog and cat owners who want to breed their pets may consult a veterinarian for routine evaluations (at least annually) and whenever breeding problems are suspected or detected.A veterinarian with knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of male canine and feline reproductive systems and their functions can provide advice on breeding and help diagnose the cause of breeding problems.
