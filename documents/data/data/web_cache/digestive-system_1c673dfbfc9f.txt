Diverticula are pouch-like dilatations of the esophageal wall and may be congenital or acquired. They are rare in dogs and cats. Acquired diverticula are of two types: pulsion or traction.
Pulsion diverticula
result from increased intraluminal pressure or deep esophageal inflammation, which can lead to mucosal herniation
predisposing conditions: esophagitis, esophageal stricture, foreign bodies, vascular ring anomalies, megaesophagus, and hiatal hernia
involve esophageal mucosa, submucosa and muscularis
Traction diverticula
result from inflammation in the chest cavity in close proximity to the esophagus
fibrous tissue is produced, then contracts, pulling esophageal wall outward
involve all layers of the esophagus
Small diverticula may be subclinical. Large diverticula allow food to become trapped in the pouch, leading to postprandial dyspnea, regurgitation, and anorexia. Survey radiographs may show the diverticulum if it is full of ingesta or air; however, contrast radiographs are best to demonstrate the pouch. Endoscopy will also allow visualization and can identify ulceration and scarring.
Small diverticula may be treated with a bland, soft diet fed with the animal in an upright position. Large diverticula require surgical excision and reconstruction of the esophageal wall. The prognosis after surgery is fair to good.
