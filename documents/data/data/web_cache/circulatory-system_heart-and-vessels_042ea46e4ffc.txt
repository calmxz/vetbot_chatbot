Endocardial fibroelastosis, a disease of unknown cause, is characterized by diffuse thickening of the left atrial, left ventricular, and/or mitral valve endocardium. It is a rare cause of myocardial failure in young dogs and cats. Affected animals are usually < 6 months old and present with clinical signs of left heart failure. Breeds reported to be affected include Labrador Retrievers, Great Danes, Bulldogs, English Springer Spaniels, Boxers, pit bulls, and Siamese and Burmese cats (in which the disease is believed to be inherited). Echocardiography demonstrates dilation of the left ventricular and atrial chambers, decreased left ventricular fractional shortening due to an increased left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and possibly diffuse endocardial thickening. Clinical signs, treatment, and prognosis are similar to those of dilated cardiomyopathy.
