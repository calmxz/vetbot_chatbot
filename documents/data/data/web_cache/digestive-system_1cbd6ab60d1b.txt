Rectal neoplasia includes benign lesions, such as polyps and adenomas, or malignant neoplasms, such as adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, plasmacytomas, and leiomyosarcomas. In dogs, colorectal polyps may undergo transformation in situ into carcinoma and, eventually, malignant carcinoma. Miniature Dachshunds are predisposed to developing inflammatory polyps, which are often multiple and may resemble malignant neoplasia.
Clinical Findings of Rectal Neoplasia in Dogs and Cats
Clinical findings of rectal neoplasia in dogs and cats include the following:
hematochezia
tenesmus
constipation
dyschezia
diarrhea
Diagnosis of Rectal Neoplasia in Dogs and Cats
Digital rectal examination
Endoscopy
Biopsy
Treatment of Rectal Neoplasia in Dogs and Cats
Endoscopic resection
Surgical resection
Chemotherapy
Rectal stenting
For rectal polyps and adenomas, endoscopic resection or surgical resection via eversion of the lesion through the anus is often curative. For removal of malignant neoplasia, more aggressive surgical techniques, such as rectal pull-through, are often required.
Chemotherapy is recommended for lymphoma and as adjunctive therapy after incomplete resection of malignant neoplasia. Inflammatory polyps in Dachshunds often require immunosuppressive therapy, such as steroids or cyclosporine, to decrease risk of recurrence.
